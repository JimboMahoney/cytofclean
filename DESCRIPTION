Description: 
    Intended to save time analysing CyTOF files by automating the initial gating steps.
    A simple program that takes (normalised) FCS files from a CyTOF v3 (Helios) and automatically gates the data based
    on the Gaussian parameters and optimal bead Channel (EQ beads). The resulting files, containing only cells, will be much 
    smaller and can thus be uploaded to Cytobank more quickly / take up less space or analysed in FlowJo / FCS Express etc.
